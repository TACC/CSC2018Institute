# Introduction to OpenStack CLI

The 
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/">
OpenStack command line interface (CLI)</a> 
is only one way to interact with OpenStack's 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>ful 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>.
In this exercise we will use the command line clients installed on Jetstream 
instances to OpenStack entities; e.g. 
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/">images</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/server.html">instances</a>,
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/volume.html">volumes</a>,
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/object.html">objects</a>, 
<a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/network.html">networks</a>,
etc.

It is important to note that you should be using the latest version of the OpenStack 
clients.  <b>This tutorial was developed with openstack --version = openstack 3.8.1</b>
If your commands are failing, a likely cause would be outdated clients.  The old, 
outdated project commands have been included if all else fails.

# Getting started with the hands on portion of the tutorial

### Insuring that your credentials are in order

Jetstream is an XSEDE resource and you must have an XSEDE account before you
can use it either via the Atmosphere user interface or the OpenStack API.
The following steps must work before proceeding; specifically, accessing
the Horizon dashboard. If you cannot login to the Horizon dashboard, nothing 
else will work.

* Log into the <a href="https://www.xsede.org">XSEDE User portal</a> with your XSEDE username and password
* Problems with the XSEDE portal can be addressed by emailing help@xsede.org
* Authenticate to the Horizon dashboard in the TACC domain using your <b>TACC username and password</b>
* Problems with TACC credentials can be addressed at the <a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/password-reset/-/password/request-reset">TACC User Portal</a>

## openrc.sh

The openrc.sh script sets the environment variables that are needed to access 
Jetstream's API.  Create a file with this content named openrc.sh

```
# API access for Jetstream is always to the tacc domain
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=tacc
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=tacc

# the specific project and user accessing the API
export OS_PROJECT_NAME=TG-TRA170023
export OS_USERNAME=tgxxxxxx
export OS_PASSWORD=‚Äùxxxxxxx"

# endpoint information; i.e. which cloud
export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://tacc.jetstream-cloud.org:5000/v3
#export OS_AUTH_URL=https://iu.jetstream-cloud.org:35357/v3
```

To set the environment variables, source the openrc.sh file.
Note: make sure to source the script, not execute it
```
source openrc.sh
```

In the real world you will want not want to save your password in a file.
A much more secure way to set OS_PASSWORD is to read it from the command line
when the openrc is sourced.  E.g. 

```
echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
```

You can also have the Horizon dashboard create an openrc.sh file for you.
* Log into Horizon
* Click on Identity in the left column
* Click on minor Projects tab at the bottom of the left had side
* Select the project you wish to create the openrc.sh file for
* Click on major Project tab at the top of the left hand column
* Click on Compute on the left side
* Click on Access & Security
* Click on API Access near the top of the page
* Click on Download OpenStack RC File v3
* This script will interactively prompt for the password when it is sourced.
This is much safer then keeping your password into a file.

### Our first OpenStack command

Now try a simple command to see if things are working

```
openstack image list
```

## A few notes about openstack commands

### Command structure

* <tt>openstack NOUN VERB PARAMETERS</tt>
* <tt>openstack <b>help</b> [NOUN [VERB [PARAMETER]]]</tt>
* <tt>openstack NOUN VERB <b>-h</b></tt>    will also produce the help documentation
* Common NOUNs include <tt>image, server, volume, network, subnet, router, port,</tt> etc.
* Common verbs are <tt>list, show, set, create, delete,</tt> etc.  
* Two commonly used verbs are <tt>list</tt> and <tt>show</tt>
* <tt>list</tt> will show everything that your project is allowed to view
* <tt>show</tt> takes a name or UUID and shows the details of the specified entity 

E.g.

```
openstack image list
openstack image show JS-API-Featured-CentOS7-May-11-2018
openstack image show bd0a7a4c-bb4c-483a-9047-0294381b3efd
```

### Names verses UUIDs
* names and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier">Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)</a>
are interchangeable on the command line

* <b>IMPORTANT POINT TO NOTE:</b> OpenStack will let you name two or more entities with 
the same names.  If you run into problems controlling something via its name, then 
fall back to the UUID of the entity.
* Once you have two entities with the same name, your only recourse is to use the UUID

# Creating the cyberinfrastructure and booting your first instance

We will be following the short tutorial on the Jetstream documentation Wiki<a href="https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JWT/OpenStack+command+line">https://iujetstream.atlassian.net/wiki/display/JWT/OpenStack+command+line</a>

It is informative  to follow what's happening in the Horizon dashboard as you execute commands.
Keep in mind that in OpenStack everything is project based.  More than likely, everyone in 
this tutorial is in the same OpenStack project.  In the Horizon dashboard you will see 
the results of all the other students commands as they execute them.

### What we're going to do
* Create security group and add rules
* Create and upload ssh keys
* Create and configure the network (this is only done once)
* Start an instance
* Shutdown the instance
* Dismantle what we have built

### Create security group and adding rules to the group

Create the group that we will be adding rules to

```
openstack security group create --description "ssh & icmp enabled" ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
```

Create a rule for allowing ssh inbound from an IP address

```
openstack security group rule create --proto tcp --dst-port 22:22 --src-ip 0.0.0.0/0 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
```

Create a rule that allows ping and other ICMP packets

```
openstack security group rule create --proto icmp ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
```

Optional rule to allow connectivity within a mini-cluster;  i.e. if you boot more
than one instance, this rule allows for comminications amonst all those instances.

```
openstack security group rule create --proto tcp --dst-port 1:65535 --src-ip 10.0.0.0/0 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
openstack security group rule create --proto udp --dst-port 1:65535 --src-ip 10.0.0.0/0 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
```

A better (more restrictive) example might be:

```
openstack security group rule create --proto tcp --dst-port 1:65535 --src-ip 10.X.Y.0/0 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
openstack security group rule create --proto udp --dst-port 1:65535 --src-ip 10.X.Y.0/0 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
```

Adding/removing security groups after an instance is running

```
openstack server add    security group ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
openstack server remove security group ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh
```

Note: that when you change the rules within a security group you are changing them in
real-time on running instances.  When we boot the instance below, we will specify which
security groups we want to associate to the running instance.

### Access to your instances will be via ssh keys

If you do not already have an ssh key we will need to create on.  For this
tutorial we will create a passwordless key.  In the real world, you would
not want to do this

```
ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f ${OS_USERNAME}-api-key -P ""
```

Upload your key to OpenStack

```
openstack keypair create --public-key ${OS_USERNAME}-api-key.pub ${OS_USERNAME}-api-key
```


### Create and configure the network (this is usually only done once)

Create the network

```
openstack network create ${OS_USERNAME}-api-net
```

List the networks; do you see yours?

```
openstack network list
```

Create a subnet within your network.  Note the X & Y in the address range.  Each student 
in this class (technically, this OpenStack project) will need to use a unique subnet range

```
openstack subnet create --network ${OS_USERNAME}-api-net --subnet-range 10.X.Y.0/24 ${OS_USERNAME}-api-subnet1
```

Create a router

```
openstack router create ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router
```

Attach your subnet to the router 

```
openstack router add subnet ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router ${OS_USERNAME}-api-subnet1
```

Attach your router to the public (externally routed) network

```
openstack router set --external-gateway public ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router
```

Note the details of your router

```
openstack router show ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router
```


### Start an instance

Note the flavors (sizes) of instances that create

```
openstack flavor list
```

Note the possible images that you can use on the API side of Jetstream.  

```
openstack image list --limit 500 | grep JS-API-Featured
```

<b>Make sure to pick an image with the string JS-API-Featured in it</b>; unless
you are booting an image created by taking a snapshot of a JS-API-Featured instance.
Images without the -API- string are destined to be boot via Atmosphere.  Atmosphere
runs various scripts during the boot process.  If you are booting via the API then these 
scripts will not get executed and the booted instance may (probably) will not be
usable.

### Time to boot your instance

```
openstack server create ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 \
--flavor <FLAVOR> \
--image <IMAGE-NAME> \
--key-name ${OS_USERNAME}-api-key \
--security-group ${OS_USERNAME}-global-ssh \
--nic net-id=${OS_USERNAME}-api-net
```

Note that ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 is the name of the running instance. Pick a 
name that means something to you.  Each instance you boot should have a unique
name; otherwise, you will have to control your instances via the UUID

Create an IP address...

```
openstack floating ip create public
```

...then add that IP address to your running instance.

```
openstack server add floating ip ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 <your.ip.number.here>
```

Is the instance reachable?

```
ping <your.ip.number.here>
ssh root@<your.ip.number.here>

```


### Putting our instance into a non-running state


Reboot the instance (shutdown -r now).
```
openstack server reboot ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
openstack server reboot ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 --hard
```

Stop the instance (shutdown -h now).
Note that state is not retained and that resources are still reserved on the compute
host so that when you decide restart the instance, resources are available to
activate the instance.

```
openstack server stop ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
openstack server start ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
```

Pause the instance
Note that your instance still remains in memory, state is retained, and resources continue
to be reserved on the compute host assuming that you will be restarting the instance.

```
openstack server pause   ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
openstack server unpause ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
```

Put the instance to sleep; similar to closing the lid on your laptop.  
Note that resources are still reserved on the compute host for when you 
decide restart the instance

```
openstack server suspend ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
openstack server resume  ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
```

Shut the instance down and move to storage.  Memory state is not maintained. Ephemeral 
storage is maintained. 

```
openstack server shelve ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
openstack server unshelve ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
```


### Dismantling what we have built

Note that infrastructure such as networks, routers, subnets, etc. only need to be 
created once and are usable by all members of the project.  These steps are included
for completeness.  And, to clean up for the next class. 

Remove the IP from the instance

```
openstack server remove floating ip ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1 <your.ip.number.here>
```

Return the IP to the pool

```
openstack floating ip delete <your.ip.number.here>
```

Delete the instance

```
openstack server delete ${OS_USERNAME}-api-U-1
```

Unplug your router from the public network

```
openstack router unset --external-gateway ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router
```

Remove the subnet from the network

```
openstack router remove subnet ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router ${OS_USERNAME}-api-subnet1
```

Delete the router

```
openstack router delete ${OS_USERNAME}-api-router
```

Delete the subnet

```
openstack subnet delete ${OS_USERNAME}-api-subnet1
```

Delete the network

```
openstack network delete ${OS_USERNAME}-api-net
```

## For further investigation...

A tutorial was presented at the PEARC17 conference on 
<a href="https://github.com/ECoulter/Tutorial_Practice">
how to build a SLURM HPC cluster with OpenStack
</a>  
The tutorial assumes that a node at IP 149.165.157.95 is running 
that you need to login to as a first step.  This node was provided as
an easy way to run the class and its only purpose was to provide a 
host with the openstack CLI clients installed.  You can safely skip
this step and proceed with executing the openstack commands you see
in the tutorial.
