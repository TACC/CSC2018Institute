### Objectives for the Computational Science in the Cloud Summer Institute

 Provide attendees the basic skills needed to:
 1. Use cloud infrastructure-as-a-service for launching virtual servers
 2. Automate cloud deployments using devops tools such as Ansible
 3. Build a progressively more complex reproducible computational environment using progressively more automation
 4. Write Python scripts within Jupyter notebooks for performing reproducible data analysis
 5. Utilize cloud APIs such as Agave for accessing and storing results
