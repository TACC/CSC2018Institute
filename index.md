Spend a week with TACC's web and cloud computing experts learning about tools, techniques, and best practices for doing high throughput computing, using virtual machines, containers, and recipes to ensure that your runtime environment is reproducible, even if you need to scale out. Be prepared to take the lessons you learn at TACC back to your own research project with hands-on exercises and one-on-one time with our experts talking about the specifics of your own research project and goals. Hear about the latest tools and research in distributed and cloud computing with invited talks from TACC users, collaborators, and guests.

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Laptops will require a terminal application for accessing compute resources.
